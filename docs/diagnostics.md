# Application diagnostics

This application adopts a user-controlled diagnostics contract via
`devmil_logging`. Safe recent events stay in memory, with bounds of 1,000 events
and 256 KiB and a 2 KiB per-event ceiling. Detailed capture expires after fifteen
minutes or when the engine exits. Settings provides enable/disable, Clear,
preview, Save to file on desktop/web, and text Share on supported native
platforms. No application-owned temporary export files or automatic uploads are
used. Exports contain application/build and platform metadata, not stable device
identifiers. Saved or shared copies remain outside Clear history.

Product policy is in `lib/logging/diagnostic_policy.dart`: reviewed structured
events and exact static legacy messages are admitted; interpolated legacy text
and arbitrary external exception text are excluded. New events use static
`DiagnosticEvent` codes and bounded numeric fields. Secrets and private product
content are excluded even in detailed mode. Development console output requires
an explicit `DEVMIL_DIAGNOSTIC_CONSOLE=true` Dart define and a debug build.

Applications with a Rust layer install its shared availability hook through their
existing FRB transport. Native history is capped at 256 events and 64 KiB;
only one notification is outstanding until Dart drains it. No raw native error
payload crosses this path. Platform frameworks and SDKs outside app-owned
logging may still have their own output; audit those separately.

Automated verification and target-platform Save/Share acceptance are separate.
Do not infer installed artifact, native bridge load, or platform share-sheet
acceptance from host unit tests. Existing automatic log files from earlier
versions are not imported or exported by the new history.

To qualify the actual host native library, build its Rust `cdylib`, set
`DEVMIL_LOGGING_NATIVE_LIBRARY` to that artifact, and run
`flutter test tool/native_diagnostic_hook_test.dart`. This checks the generated
FRB availability hook and drain/configure calls end to end. It does not replace
an installed application or platform share-sheet check.
